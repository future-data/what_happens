### This excercise is to play around weather and airline delay data, and making prediction using spark mllib 

1.  Download weather datasets  2007.csv.gz  and 2008.csv.gz from
http://www1.ncdc.noaa.pub/gov/data/ghcn/daily/by_year/
	

2.  Download airline delay history

http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/2007.csv.bz2


http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/2008.csv.bz2

3.  Pre-process data using pig from following location
	scripts/preprocess.pig

4.  Analyze the correlation between weather and airline dealy.
5.  Use spark mllib, to build a predictive system, the architecture should take current weather as feed and predict airline delay.
